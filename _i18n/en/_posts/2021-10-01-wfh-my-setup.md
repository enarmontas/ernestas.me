Since the pandemic happened, I always wanted to create a minimal,
but ergonomic working environment at home.

Finally, I am happy how it turned out:

In short, it's is a well built mobile workstation, which runs absolutely great with Linux. 
It’s a perfect choice for engineers who need enough computing power and a 
comfortable typing experience. Works for me.

Check [my own review](/lenovo-thinkpad-p1-gen3) of the Lenovo ThinkPad P1 for more details.

## Monitor: LG 27" 4K UHD IPS (27UK670-B)
Shop: [Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07NDMQKTC)

![LG 27" 4K UHD IPS](/images/2021/10/home-office-2.jpg)
It's an affordable 4K UHD monitor with a built-in USB-C hub. 
The monitor has a low input lag, good color accuracy, wide viewing angles, 
and a great resolution that enchances details nicely. 
USB-C hub provides 60W of power to my laptop, enough to charge it during low performance usage. 
It's more than enough for me.

## Keyboard: Logitech MX Keys

Keyboards are something you can never have enough. I owned a wide range of keyboards, 
but I can't remember ever being happy with at least one of them. Some keyboards are too loud, 
some don't have the basic functionality like multiple Bluetooth device connections, 
others are locked to a single platform.  

Logitech MX Keys solved all of those issues for me. I think, 
I finally found the right (not perfect) keyboard. It gives me a decent typing expierence 
both on Linux and macOS.

## Mouse: Logitech MX Master 3

![Logitech MX Master 3](/images/2021/10/logitech-mx-master-3-1.jpg)
MX Master 3 is one of the best computer mouses you can get on the market. 
Reviews are wonderful and I am happy with it, but I still think that any cheaper 
Logitech mouse would do the job.

## Headphones: Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro

Great in-ear headphones for meetings and casual music listening. Easy to use, strong audio performance, average active noise cancellation and a decent battery life. Sounds good to me.

## Lamp: Ikea Riggad

(Riggad is not manufactured anymore, the new model is Nymåne).

I can't say much about a lamp. It works. It even has an USB and a wireless charging ports.

## Chair: Ikea Alefjäll

It's very rare to find a comfortable office chair that also looks stylish.
Distinct retro design makes it fit into my home office corner nicely.
It has a tilt and height adjustment function for back support, seat and backrest 
adjustments for my height and posture.
The build quality seems robust, so it should last for a long time.

<a name="desk"></a>
## Desk: Narbutas Active
Shop: [Narbutas](https://www.narbutas.com/products/desks-desks/sit-stand-desks/active/)

![Narbutas Active](/images/2021/10/custom-desk-2.jpg)
Here is how the desk looked originally. 
When I got it from my work office, I have removed the original desk top and replaced it with a custom one made from oak.

Here is how it looks after the replacement. Better, right?
