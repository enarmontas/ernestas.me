![Ubuntu Installation](/assets/images/2017/ubuntu_1.jpg)

I previously wrote a [tutorial](/2016/01/21/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-unattended-installation) on how to automate Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 LTS installation, but for 16.04 it didn't work because of some differences in installation media.

Here's a full and tested solution to create your unattended Ubuntu installation media. For me the process on VirtualBox guest took about 30 minutes to fully boot into working system without even touching the keyboard.

### 1. Create Kickstart file
Install Kickstart by typing this command into Terminal:

    sudo apt-get install system-config-kickstart

After the installation process is completed, open Kickstart Configurator using Unity search or just by typing `system-config-kickstart` in Terminal.

When the Kickstart opens, choose the settings you need for your installation. You can review all possible options on the official Kickstart Configurator [documentation site](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/installation_guide/ch-redhat-config-kickstart).

When you are finished with the configuration, press File > Save File in the top menu. Keep default file name as `ks.cfg` and save it to your Desktop. Some of the options doesn't work in Kickstart configurator, but it can be edited manually after saving `ks.cfg`.

Here are the contents of my `ks.cfg` file:

    #Generated by Kickstart Configurator
    #platform=AMD64 or Intel EM64T

    #System language
    lang en_US
    #Language modules to install
    langsupport en_US
    #System keyboard
    keyboard us
    #System mouse
    mouse
    #System timezone
    timezone America/New_York
    #Root password
    rootpw --disabled
    #Initial user
    user ernestas --fullname "Ernestas" --iscrypted --password $1$dLKYoVUI$nb3qZVsrV7IIJMia1kskE0
    #Reboot after installation
    reboot
    #Use text mode install
    text
    #Install OS instead of upgrade
    install
    #Use CDROM installation media
    cdrom
    #System bootloader configuration
    bootloader --location=mbr
    #Clear the Master Boot Record
    zerombr yes
    #Partition clearing information
    clearpart --all --initlabel
    #Disk partitioning information
    part swap --size 2048
    part /boot --fstype ext4 --size 512
    part / --fstype ext4 --size 1 --grow
    #System authorization infomation
    auth  --useshadow  --enablemd5
    #Network information
    network --bootproto=dhcp --device=eth0
    #Firewall configuration
    firewall --disabled
    #Do not configure the X Window System
    skipx

    # Additional packages to install
    %packages
    ca-certificates
    openssl
    python
    openssh-server
    vim
    ubuntu-desktop
    unity

    # Add your custom post installation script here
    %post

    # Add post installation script to /usr/local/bin/ directory
    mkdir /mnt/cdrom
    mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
    cp /mnt/cdrom/post.sh /usr/local/bin/
    chown ernestas:ernestas /usr/local/bin/post.sh
    chmod 744 /usr/local/bin/post.sh

    # Fix locale
    echo 'LANG="en_US.UTF-8"' > /etc/default/locale
    echo 'LANGUAGE="en_US:en"' >> /etc/default/locale
    echo 'LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"' >> /etc/default/locale

    # Clean
    apt-get -f -y install
    apt-get -y autoremove
    apt-get clean

### 2. Create Preseed file
Pressed commands work when they are directly written inside the Kickstart file, but I wanted to separate the two files. Create new file on you desktop named `ubuntu-auto.seed` with the following contents:

    # Unmount drives with active partitions. Without this command all the installation process would stop and require confirmation to unmount drives that are already mounted.
    d-i preseed/early_command string umount /media || true

    # Don't install recommended items
    d-i preseed base-installer/install-recommends boolean false

    # Install only security updates automatically
    d-i preseed pkgsel/update-policy select unattended-upgrades
For additional Preseed configuration options, refer to official Ubuntu [installation guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/armhf/apbs01.html).

### 3. Create post installation script
Create a file named `post.sh` with your desired commands.

Even if Kickstart has the `%post` section, sometimes you may need to make some changes only after the system has fully booted.

My `ks.cfg` copies `post.sh` file to `/usr/local/bin` directory for that. If you don't want to use the post installation script simply comment out the commands in `ks.cfg` after `# Add post installation script...` line.

Here is my shortened `post.sh` file for example:

    #!/bin/bash
    # Set hostname
    read -p "Hostname: " pcHost
    echo "Changing the hostname to $pcHost"
    sed -i "s/ubuntu/$pcHost/g" /etc/hostname
    sed -i "s/ubuntu/$pcHost/g" /etc/hosts


### 4. Extract original ISO image
Download [Ubuntu Server 16.04 x64](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server/thank-you?version=16.04.1&architecture=amd64) from official Ubuntu website and put it on your desktop. It is necessary to use server version, because desktop version doesn't support unattended installations. Desktop functionality will work after `ubuntu-desktop` package in `%packages` section of `kb.cfg` file is installed.

Mount the `.iso` file to Ubuntu filesystem. The commands below will mount `.iso` file to the folder named `ubuntu_iso`:

    cd ~/Desktop
    mkdir ubuntu_iso
    sudo mount -r -o loop ubuntu-16.04.1-server-amd64.iso ubuntu_iso

Copy `.iso` contents to another folder on your desktop so we can edit the files. Don't forget to set the right permissions to be able to make changes.

    mkdir ubuntu_files
    rsync -a ubuntu_iso/ ubuntu_files/
    sudo chown ernestas:ernestas ubuntu_files
    sudo chmod 755 ubuntu_files
    sudo umount ubuntu_iso
    rm -rf ubuntu_iso

### 5. Edit contents of ISO image
Copy `ks.cfg`, `ubuntu-auto.seed` and `post.sh` files to newly created `ubuntu_files` folder

    cp {ks.cfg,ubuntu-auto.seed,post.sh} ubuntu_files
    chmod 644 ubuntu_files/ks.cfg ubuntu_files/ubuntu-auto.seed
    chmod 744 ubuntu_files/post.sh

Change `isolinux` folder and `isolinux/txt.cfg` permissions for editing:

    chmod 755 ubuntu_files/isolinux ubuntu_files/isolinux/txt.cfg ubuntu_files/isolinux/isolinux.cfg

Now we need to make the installer read Kickstart and Preseed files by including new menu selection for automatic Ubuntu installation. To do this edit `txt.cfg` in `isolinux` folder:

    nano ubuntu_files/isolinux/txt.cfg

Paste the following content right after the line containing `default install`:

    label autoinstall
      menu label ^Automatically install Ubuntu
      kernel /install/vmlinuz
      append file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-server.seed vga=788 initrd=/install/initrd.gz ks=cdrom:/ks.cfg preseed/file=/cdrom/ubuntu-auto.seed quiet --

Set timeout to start the installation automatically:

    sed -i -r 's/timeout\s+[0-9]+/timeout 3/g' ubuntu_files/isolinux/isolinux.cfg

Warning! This command will start installation proccess immediately and format the hard drive as defined in `ks.cfg`. Skip it if you want to manually start the process after booting into ISO.

Change the permissions back:

    chmod 555 ubuntu_files/isolinux
    chmod 444 ubuntu_files/isolinux/txt.cfg ubuntu_files/isolinux/isolinux.cfg

### 6. Recreate ISO image
Create new `.iso`:

    sudo mkisofs -D -r -V "ubuntu-auto" -J -l -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -input-charset utf-8 -cache-inodes -quiet -o ubuntu-auto.iso ubuntu_files/

Remove files:

    sudo rm -rf ubuntu_files

### 7. Optional â€“ Create bootable USB media
Make the `.iso` file bootable from external USB devices:

    sudo apt-get install syslinux-utils
    sudo isohybrid ubuntu-auto.iso

Plug in USB device and determine the path to it:

    lsblk

My USB device was identified as `/dev/sdb`. Unmount the media:

    sudo umount /dev/sdb

Copy ISO to USB device. Make sure to copy directly to the drive, not the first partition (`/dev/sdb`~~`1`~~)

    sudo dd if=ubuntu-auto.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M && sync

### 8. Known Issues
8.1. USB doesn't mount as CD-ROM
Error message:
"Your installation CD-ROM couldn't be mounted. This probably means that the CD-ROM was not in the drive. If so you can insert it and try again."

Fix: Use dd to create bootable USB. Previuosly this error was caused by Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator.
