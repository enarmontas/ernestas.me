Hi, my name is **Ernestas**. I'm a systems engineer who solves infrastructure problems with code.

I work as Site Reliability Engineer at [Vinted](https://vinted.com),
where I make sure our cloud infrastructure is up and running.
Before that, I worked as Systems Administrator at [Wix](https://wix.com) and
Network Administrator at [VMU](https://www.vdu.lt/en).

In this blog, I'm sharing my opinion and experience about personal and work projects.
I'm documenting my lessons and mistakes, so others can learn from them.

In my spare time, I'm usually reading, writing, exploring interesting places
and [photographing architecture](https://www.instagram.com/ernestas.n/).
