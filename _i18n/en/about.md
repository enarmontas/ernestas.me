My name is **Ernestas**. I'm a system engineer based in Vilnius, Lithuania.

I love technology, automating things, building scalable and reliable systems.
I am driven by that feeling when "it just works" after hitting the return key.

I work as Site Reliability Engineer at [Vinted](https://vinted.com) where I solve infrastructure problems with code.
Before that, I worked as System Administrator at [Wix](https://wix.com) and Network Administrator at [VMU](https://www.vdu.lt/en).

On my spare time, I'm usually reading, writing, exploring places and [photographing architecture](https://www.instagram.com/ernestas.n/).

In this blog, I'm sharing my opinion and knowledge about personal and work projects. The main goal is to document my learnings and mistakes so others can benefit from them.
