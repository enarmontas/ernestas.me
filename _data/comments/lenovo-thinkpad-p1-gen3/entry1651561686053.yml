message: "I would agree. My T14 Gen 2 with a 5850U has excellent performance and battery life and no need to compromise on not having a nice UHD display either, Intel really has lost the plot as well as the game.\r\n\r\nIn regards to your review, what surprises me is that if you spend most of your time using a large ext monitor, why do you even care about the touchpad?"
