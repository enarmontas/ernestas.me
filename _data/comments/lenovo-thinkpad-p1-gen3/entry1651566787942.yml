message: "Yeah I tried Ubuntu before. It is slightly better but still all kinds of funny business with the nvidia driver. (the hdmi port just didn't work)\r\nThe only reason I switch to MacOS now, is the fact that my company only allows this Thinkpad or a MacBook for work. (And I will not go back to Windows :)"
