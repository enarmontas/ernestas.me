message: "Thanks! \r\n\r\nI had to chime in that, if 14\" vs 15.6\" is not a deal breaker, P14s Gen 2 with Ryzen 5850U, 32GB RAM and integrated GPU is the most performant, silent, portable and generally capable laptop I ever had (and I've changed a lot).\r\n\r\nI got greedy and switched to a MBP 14 with M1 Pro, which is also great, but almost everything (speakers and trackpad excepted) on P14s was either on par or even better (perf, ports, weight, noise, keyboard, build, screen, battery...). MBP is excellent, but I miss my Arch setup a lot and don't think I would miss anything from the MBP actually if I switched back.\r\n\r\nI know Lenovo is going downwards with Thinkpad line, but P series seems to still hold well."
