message: "Hi Ernestas,\r\n\r\nThanks for the post, it helped me to chose a ThinkPad Lenovo as a work machine to replace my Macbook Pro Mid 2015 (Retina) after many years working with macOS. \r\n\r\nI bought a ThinkPad P15v Gen 3, i7 12700h, 16GB wth Windows and as soon I received it, I upgraded it to 64GB and added a second M.2 SSD where I installed Ubuntu 20.04.5 to work with development.\r\n\r\nAlthough my machine is a little bit different from yours, it has a great performance, no fan issues or other issues, the track pad is not good but I always use a mouse and the screen brightness compared to a Mac a little bit worst, sometimes I get myself trying to increase the brightness but I'm already at maximum."
