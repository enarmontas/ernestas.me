  I use a P1 Gen2 for work and also had multiple issues with the trackpad, at
  the end only way to get it working was to disable it while a mouse is
  connected, and to disable the left and right click buttons at all time. Dont
  know why such a premium laptop has such a weird issue with its trackpad.
  Otherwise its a great laptop.
