message: "Each comment has a permalink with unique ID. When you reply to the comment, the ID is saved to the `replying_to_uid` field, which is then rendered as a reply. You can see an example [here](https://github.com/enarmontas/ernestas.me/blob/master/_data/comments/static-comments-for-jekyll-with-github-pages/entry1651525056238.yml). \r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't support nested replies, that's why I can't reply directly to you now, but I can always use the same thread."
